This is a C++ wrapper for the NeuroSky Mindwave. 

Its purpose is for teaching students to control the robot. 

The original code was supplied by the University of Lincoln (UK) - Dr John Murray.

Here at the University of Lincoln Computing Society we are trying to help improve the teaching 
tools for future students.
